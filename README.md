# Mastermind in Ruby

[TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop?ref=lnav#project-2-mastermind) curriculum project.

The Mastermind board game played in the terminal.

The game lets you play as either code-breaker or code-maker. You can also twiddle with the game's configuration a little bit.

The computer will (I'm pretty sure) always break your code in 6 turns or less. Give it a shot!
